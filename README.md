### Explanation
The code uses a loop to simulate the movement of two objects along a number line and checks if they will meet after a certain number of jumps. Each line of code contributes to the algorithm that models the objects' positions and predicts their meeting point.
Meeting method declaration:

The method takes initial positions, velocities, and the maximum number of jumps as parameters.
It returns a String indicating whether the objects will meet or not.
for loop (line 12):

Iterates through each jump.
Position update (lines 15-16):

Updates the positions of both objects based on their velocities.
Check for meeting (lines 18-20):

Checks if the objects have the same position after each jump.
main method (lines 24-29):

Example usage with initial positions, velocities, and the maximum number of jumps.
Calls predictMeeting and prints the outcome.

<a name="DatabaseQueryOptimization"></a> [Database Query Optimization](#) - In the context of a database system where query optimization is crucial, you are tasked with implementing a binary search algorithm to efficiently locate a specific record in a large dataset. Write a Java program that performs binary search on an array and returns the index of the target record or -1 if it's not found.
  ```
public class DatabaseQueryOptimizer {

    /**
     * Performs binary search to locate a record in a sorted array.
     *

These lines are Javadoc comments providing documentation for the binarySearch method. They describe the purpose of the method, its parameters (array and target), and the return value.
java
Copy code
    public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int target) {
This line declares the start of a public static method named binarySearch. It takes an integer array array and an integer target as parameters and returns an integer.
java
Copy code
        int left = 0;
        int right = array.length - 1;
These lines initialize two variables, left and right, representing the boundaries of the search space in the array. left is set to the beginning of the array, and right is set to the end.
java
Copy code
        while (left <= right) {
This line starts a while loop that continues as long as the left boundary is less than or equal to the right boundary.
java
Copy code
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
This line calculates the middle index of the current search space. It helps determine if the target element is in the left or right half of the array.
java
Copy code
            if (array[mid] == target) {
This line checks if the element at the middle index (mid) of the array is equal to the target. If true, the target is found, and the method returns the index.
java
Copy code
                return mid;
            } else if (array[mid] < target) {
If the target is greater than the element at mid, the search continues in the right half of the array.
java
Copy code
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
If the target is less than the element at mid, the search continues in the left half of the array.
java
Copy code
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
This block adjusts the search space boundaries (left and right) based on whether the target is in the left or right half of the array.
java
Copy code
        return -1;
If the while loop exits without finding the target, the method returns -1, indicating that the target is not present in the array.
java
Copy code
    }
}
These lines close the binarySearch method and the DatabaseQueryOptimizer class.
